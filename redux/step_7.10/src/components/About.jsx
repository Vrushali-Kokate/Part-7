    <p>According to Wikipedia:</p>

    <em>
      An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. 
      Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose 
      is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself.
    </em>
